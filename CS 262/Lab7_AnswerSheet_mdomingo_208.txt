Lab 7
Debugging Code with GDB

Answer Sheet
Name: Marcus Domingo

Lab Section: 208

Complete this answer sheet using the instructions given in the lab. Turn in a hard copy of your completed sheet to your TA by the beginning of your lab next week. All questions are worth 1/2 point, with the exception of question 17 (the last question) which is worth 2 points.

Compiling
1) Write the size (in bytes) of the executable 7924 (Note: The size in bytes is the number immediately before the date in the output from the ls -l command)

2) Now, recompile using the -g command line option and write the size in bytes of the new executable: 11116

Starting GDB
3) Copy the first line that is printed when you run gdb: GNU gdb (GDB) Red Hat Enterprise Linux (7.2-83.el6)

4) Now, copy the portion in the quotes on the line that states "This GDB was configured as." For instance, in the example above, you would copy i686-linux-gnu: x86_64-redhat-linux-gnu

Getting Help
5) Write the number of topics/classes: 12

6) Now, type "help break" to get specific information:
Write the first line printed after executing the command here: Set breakpoint at specified line or function.

Running a Program
7) Try it now. What happened?

Starting program: /home/mdomingo/Lab7_mdomingo_208/Lab7 
Usage: /home/mdomingo/Lab7_mdomingo_208/Lab7 [1 2]
           1 = Mode 1
           2 = Mode 2

Program exited normally.


8) Try the run command again, this time adding "1" (without quotes) to the command line. What happened this time?

Starting program: /home/mdomingo/Lab7_mdomingo_208/Lab7 1
Here we are in DebugOption1()
The sum of integers from 0 to 10 is: 1013

Program exited with code 052.

Setting Breakpoints
9) At what line number does execution pause? line 55

A Brief Digression
10) Write what you see as a result: $1 = 1

Stepping Through Code
11) Use the print statement mentioned above to print the current value of sum. What is its current value? 0

12) Now, use the step command step over the current line. At what line does the execution pause? 58

13) Print the value of sum again. What is its value now? 0

14) Continue stepping through the program until the following line is reached:

sum += sum + i;
15) Print the value of sum: 0

Displaying Variables
16) What is the value of the variable 'i' at this point? 6

17) Once you see what the bug is, describe it below (2 points):

The statement is adding the sum 2 times.  The correct way would be sum = sum + i or sum += i.  The way it is written adds the sum twice that's why the output is incorrect.
Also another bug is that instead of is being i < SIZE, it needs to be i <= SIZE, otherwise we get a sum of 45 when it sould be 55.
